# Voice based automation in Banking Sector
 VBABS is a my final year bachelors project. It is a java based project with the integration of Machine learning in it.
 The main motto of this project is to create a system or platform, where we can minimize some redundant work load on employees at the bank and to implement some automation into it.
We implement our source code and deployed it to work with ALEXA. Where user can give there inputs and ask question and the machine was being trained to reply to some pre-configured questions.
We also implemented some ML techniques, where the OCR is being used to fetch the data from the documents uploaded by the user and then we used that data to predcit some results based on our previous data available.
